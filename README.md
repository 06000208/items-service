# items service

This is a node.js web server which provides a frontend and api for storing and editing data which take the form of "items", an abstraction for anything, in a similar manner as [wikidata's items](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Items).

It may serve as a remote storage provider for the [items browser extension](https://github.com/06000208/items-extension), or be used on it's own.
